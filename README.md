# Ng2-Visualizejs
A simple demonstration that draws a [Jaspersoft](http://www.jaspersoft.com/) report/dashboard resource with the [Visualize.js](http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/visualizejs) library using the [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/) (initial commit uses Angular 2.0.0-beta.17)

> Interesting in implementing a [Visualize.js](http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/visualizejs) solution using the very popular [ng2-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap) library? Check out [this related project](https://github.com/richbl/ng2-bootstrap-visualizejs) instead.

## Based on Angular 2 QuickStart
This repository is based on a great learning resource, the [Angular 2 QuickStart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart), which is the companion source code for the Angular 2 tutorial called the ["5 Min Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)."

> Note that this project has not been forked from the [Angular 2 QuickStart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) project, so no updates made to that project will be reflected in this project.


## Prerequisites

Two sets of requirements are needed:

 - Jaspersoft resources
 - Angular Framework (*aka*, Angular 2) resources

### Jaspersoft
Required software and servers are well described on the [Jaspersoft website](http://community.jaspersoft.com/sites/default/files/wiki_attachments/main_1.html).

### Angular Framework
Node.js and npm are essential to Angular 2 development. <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm"> Get them now</a> if they're not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v5.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

> This project was originally developed using Angular 2.0.0-beta.17.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into new project folder (*e.g.*, `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/richbl/ng2-visualizejs  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

### Install npm Packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

> Attention Windows developers: you must run all of these commands in administrator mode.

```bash
npm install
```
### Install Typings (TypeScript Definition Manager)

```bash
typings install
```
This will create a `typings` folder.

### Edit Visualize.js Configuration

Configuration details for the Visualize.js library are currently managed in two files:

-`index.html`: set the library include for the Visualize.js library script (*e.g.*,  `<script src="http://visualizejsdemo.jaspersoft.com/jasperserver-pro/client/visualize.js"></script>)`
-`app/vjs.config.service.ts`: set user and resource details (*i.e.*, reports and dashboards) 

It's expected that future releases of this demonstration should permit for the dynamic loading of the Visualize.js library in the `vjs.config.service.ts` component.

> Note that this demonstration is not designed to be production-ready: including username and password in *any* local script is a serious security risk.

### Edit HTML Content Files
The file `app/app.component.html` is where the Visualize.js resources are embedded, using a custom HTML tag:  `<vjs-component id="dashboard_one"></vjs-component>`, where the `id` attribute represents the id of the resource defined in the configuration component, `vjs.config.service.ts`.

### Start the Server

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

```bash
npm start
```

> By default, the server will be running on http://localhost:3000. Open a browser page on this URL and you should see the application running.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

**You're ready to go!**
